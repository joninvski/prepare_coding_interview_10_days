## Data Structure

### Java

Collections -> LinkedList, Stack
Map         -> HashMap

Note: Hashmaps first checks map and then equals method. (i always though it only checked hash)

When threading use wait and notify

### Problems

To solve problem with Summation write the array by hand and check properties

Try to solve problem inplace (with no extra memory)

In ordered matrices try to decompose them into smaller until it is trivial, or draw matrix with properties
