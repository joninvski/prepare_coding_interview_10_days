## Matrices

If stuck on matrix try to remove columns and rows one at each time. Try to achieve O(m\*n)

## Strings

Do not forget C# and Java String immutability

Note that String a = "ola" != String a = new String("ola")

In transforming strings always ask if inplace or not

To avoid reallocating memory at every step think on solving problems from right to left (replacing chars in string and mergint two sorted arrays)

Did not understand algorithm at page 50

## Data structures

Funny how recursion can be used to print linked list from end to start

Finally understood the rabbit and turtle algorithm to find cycles in linked list
