## Tree

Do not forget the 4 types of tree searches

* Pre-order traversal - this, r(left), r(right)
* In-order traversal - r(left), this, r(right)
* Post order traversal - r(left), r(right), this
* Bread-first traversal - By level

To check if binary tree is a search binary tree

* Use min and max limits a pre-order traversal
* Also possible using post order traversal

## Stacks and Queues

* It is possible to transform two stacks into a queue
* It is possible to transform two queues into a stack
